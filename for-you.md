# TruCol

Suppose Alice wants some well-defined challenge, such as an n*n sudoku, to be solved. She writes a set of unit tests that check any given solution, using random inputs. Instead of creating the solution herself, Alice publishes the unit tests in a smart contract and sets a bounty for any other smart contract that solves it. Bob, the bounty hunter, finds the contract and codes a solution in a smart contract, in order to receive the bounty. If Alice's requirements are fulfilled, the smart contract automatically pays out the reward. This repository presents the protocol to do this completely trustless and decentralised, without taking any fees, thus increasing market efficiency.

# For Employers

We all know that making sure our code does what it is supposed to do is very important. Unfortunately, due to time constraints tests are often rushed or neglected. TruCol makes the process painfree, all you have to do is set the acceptance requirements, provide a bounty and let the community do the rest !


# For Hunters

Do you like to tinker with code snippets? Are you thorough and do you have a keen eye for detail? Would you like to make money combining these traits and your coding-skills, if so then TruCol is exactly what you need!
