## The origins of TruCol

TruCol was founded as a project for the ETHDenver Hackathon as a collaboration between four students interested in the development of Ethereum projects. After competing in various categories, and successfully claiming multiple bounties, the team decided to continue with the development of the project. Other students who were interested in the project joined the team and several blockchain-related organisations were interested in the project.
