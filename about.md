## The origins of TruCol

We experienced that we did not always have the time or a skill for specific coding work ourselves when setting up our own company. Setting out bounties would provide a great solution for this. However, existing systems require an often costly middleperson and a modicum of trust between all parties. This is why we set out to develop a decentralized, trust-less collaboration platform and protocol for test-driven programming development. The project started at the ETHDenver Hackathon as a collaboration between four students interested in the development of Ethereum projects. After competing in various categories, and successfully claiming multiple bounties, the team decided to continue with the development of the project.
